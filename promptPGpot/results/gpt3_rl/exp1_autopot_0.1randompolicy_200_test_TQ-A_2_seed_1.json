By March he had spent 11.0 dollars . If he got another 21.0 dollars from his mom , how much money would he have ?\n# Let's think step by step to derive the answer, store the result as a 'ans' variable:\n# According to the question, we can define the variables:\n\njanuary_amount = 48.0\namount_spent = 11.0\namount_from_mom = 21.0\n\n# To get the answer, we need to calculate the sum of january_amount, amount_from_mom and subtract amount_spent:\n\nans = january_amount + amount_from_mom - amount_spent\n\n# We can now print the answer:\n\nprint(ans)\n\n# The answer is 58.0\n\nQuestion:There are 65.0 students trying out for the school 's trivia teams .
